# Refill System - TowersForPGM

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> **Configuration without match**: It's important to configure chests while there is NO match in progress

> [!WARNING]  
> **Apply changes**: When finished configuring chests, you must cycle to the same map again to apply the effects

## System Operation

The refill system **automatically refills chests every 60 seconds** starting when the match begins. Chests are refilled with the content they had before the match started.

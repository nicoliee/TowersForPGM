## Configuration in `matchbot.yml`

```yaml
tables:
  - Amistoso
  - TorneoT1
  - RankedT1
discordChannel: ""  # Discord channel where messages will be sent
rankedRoleId: ""    # Role ID to tag when using /tag
```

### Configuration description

|--------|------|-------------|
| `tables` | `array` | List of statistics tables available for consultation |
| `discordChannel` | `string` | Discord channel ID where messages will be sent |
| `rankedRoleId` | `string` | Discord role ID to mention in ranked matches |

## Ranked System

### Notification Command
```
/tag
```

### Operation
The `/tag` command works when:
- Current map belongs to the list of maps enabled for ranked
- Sends an embed to Discord mentioning the role configured in `rankedRoleId`
- Notifies about an available ranked match

> [!NOTE]  
> **Requirements to work**: The `/tag` command will not work unless you have these 3 requirements configured: **valid map** (must be in the ranked maps list), **configured role** (`rankedRoleId` with valid ID) and **configured channel** (`discordChannel` configured correctly).

# TowersForPGM

## Description

**TowersForPGM** is a Minecraft plugin that extends the functionality of the **PGM** plugin by adding new competitive and administrative features, such as:

1. **Draft System**: Allows for a player draft before starting a match, where captains can pick their teams.
2. **Preparation Time**: Provides configurable preparation time with region boundaries, timers, and potion effects.
3. **ScoreBox Statistics**: Tracks player statistics specifically for the **ScoreBox** game mode, with data stored in a MySQL database. (More game modes will be added in the future.)
